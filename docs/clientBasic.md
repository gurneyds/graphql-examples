# clientBasic.html

This is a simple html page that demonstrates how to interact with a graphQL server by making back-end requests.

There is some javascript on the page that listens for click event and then:

1. Gathers the user provided data from the page
2. Builds the data object need for graphQL
3. Posts the data to the graphQL server
4. Puts the response from the server on the page for the user to see

I realize that this code could be refactored to have less code and be more eligant - but the goal was to make things simple and readable.
